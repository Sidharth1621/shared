sonatype nexus version - 3.x

creating repo

admin -> repositories -> create repo ->name and type (maven,raw,docker) -> releases/snapshots  

types
	-> maven2 (jar/war files (GAV (groupid , artifactid, version) parameters) as well as txt and metadata files)
	-> raw (to store txt files, metadata files etc)
	-> docker (to store images)

rest API call

service/rest/v1/search/

curl -X GET https://devops.upc.biz/nexus/service/rest/v1/search/assets?repository=sangavi&name=sid.txt

--> JSON output


diff -->
maven repositories:
if txt file stored in maven2 repo like snapshots and releases, JSON output cannot be fetched through rest api call.
only files with GAV parameters will be fetched through api call.

raw repositories:
the text file uploaded will automatically contain component name and group , so it can be fetched through rest api call.

snapshots 
	-> duplicates
	-> maven hosted repository
	-> jar/war files
	-> lower env deployments (dev/jit/sit)
	
releases 
	-> no duplicates
	-> maven hosted repository
	-> jar/war files
	-> higher env deployments (prod/uat)
